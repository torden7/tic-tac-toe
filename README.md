# tic-tac-toe
A simple tic-tac-toe game

The program:
- prints an empty grid at the beginning and then prints a changed grid during each turn;
- automatically changes the turn of Xs and Os, so the players only enter the coordinates;
- asks the coordinates (from 1 to 3 right and from 1 to 3 up);
- checks if the entered coordinates are numbers and are in the range from 1 to 3, if they aren't, the program asks to enter valid coordinates;
- checks if the cell in the entered coordinates is free, if it isn't, the program asks to enter new coordinates;
- checks if there is a winner, if the game has one, the program declares the winner and finishes the game;
- if all cells are occupied and there is still no winner, the program declares that it's a draw and finishes the game.
